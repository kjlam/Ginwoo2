 GESTURES
  
  Ginect uses four Kinect gestures. One of these is a swipe. 
  
  To return to the main page, move your left hand quickly and smoothly across the screen from right to left. This is a swipe.
  
  The elements of the main Ginect pages are controlled with the use of three other gestures:
  
	1. Push
	
	Many of the buttons on the Ginect interface, including the Tag button, the Commit button and the Push button, require the 
	use of the push gesture in order to activate them, just like a real-life button that you interact with on a daily basis.
	To push on any of these buttons, make sure that your cursor is over the button and that your hands are at about
	the same distance from your body. Then move your right hand forward, as if pushing on an object, to push the button. 
	
	
	2. Pull
	
	To pull files from your remote repository and to interact with some of the other elements in Ginect, you'll want to use 
	the pull gesture. The pull gesture is just like the push gesture; the only difference is that instead of moving your right
	hand forward, you will want to move it backwards towards yourself, as if pulling on an object. 
	
	
	3. Lasso
	
	The lasso gesture is what we call the gesture used to select files to add to your commit. It works much like the lasso tool in
	Photoshop or any other illustrator. To signal that you want to begin to lasso, put your hands together at the point where you
	want to start lassoing. Then use your right hand to outline the area within which you want to select your files. When your right
	hand returns to the position of your left hand, the lasso will end and your files will be selected. Once you've lassoed, you can 
	drag your selection to the Commit Area. 
	
THE MODE SWITCHER MENU

	The three-sphere image on the right side of the sphere is the Mode Switcher Menu. It lets you move between the three modes of Ginect:
	Working Copy, Local Repository and Remote Repository. Each mode lets you perform certain actions relevant to each kind of file system.
	As is natural for the Git system, your Working Copy is represented by the sphere which is closest to you and your Remote Repository is
	represented by the sphere which is farthest away. To switch from your current mode (which is glowing) to the mode adjacent to it
	and closer to you, pull on the menu. To switch from your current mode to the mode adjacent to it but farther away, push on the menu.
